# YOLOv5 Quickstart ðŸš€

Welcome to the world of YOLOv5! Whether you're a beginner or an expert in object detection, this guide is your key to unlocking the full potential of YOLOv5. Follow along for a comprehensive walkthrough on installation, running inference, and training your own models. Let's get started!

## Install

Begin your YOLOv5 journey by cloning the repo and setting up the environment, installing all [requirements](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt) correctly. Ensure you have [**Python>=3.8.0**](https://www.python.org/) and [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
```

## Inference with PyTorch Hub

YOLOv5 [PyTorch Hub](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/pytorch_hub_model_loading) inference. [Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) download automatically from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases).

```python
import torch

# Model
model = torch.hub.load("ultralytics/yolov5", "yolov5s")  # or yolov5n - yolov5x6, custom

# Images
img = "https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg"  # or file, Path, PIL, OpenCV, numpy, list

# Inference
results = model(img)

# Results
results.print()  # or .show(), .save(), .crop(), .pandas(), etc.
```

## Inference with detect.py

`detect.py` runs inference on a variety of sources, downloading [models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) automatically from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases) and saving results to `runs/detect`.

```bash
python detect.py --weights yolov5s.pt --source 0                               # webcam
                                               img.jpg                         # image
                                               vid.mp4                         # video
                                               screen                          # screenshot
                                               path/                           # directory
                                               list.txt                        # list of images
                                               list.streams                    # list of streams
                                               'path/*.jpg'                    # glob
                                               'https://youtu.be/LNwODJXcvt4'  # YouTube
                                               'rtsp://example.com/media.mp4'  # RTSP, RTMP, HTTP stream
```

## Training

The commands below reproduce YOLOv5 [COCO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/scripts/get_coco.sh)
results. [Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models)
and [datasets](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/data) download automatically from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases). Training times for YOLOv5n/s/m/l/x are 1/2/4/6/8 days on a V100 GPU ([Multi-GPU](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/multi_gpu_training) times faster). Use the largest `--batch-size` possible, or pass `--batch-size -1` for YOLOv5 [AutoBatch](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/5092). Batch sizes shown for V100-16GB.

```bash
python train.py --data coco.yaml --epochs 300 --weights '' --cfg yolov5n.yaml  --batch-size 128
                                                                 yolov5s                    64
                                                                 yolov5m                    40
                                                                 yolov5l                    24
                                                                 yolov5x                    16
```
