# COCO8-Human Dataset

## Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) COCO8-Human is a small, but versatile object detection dataset composed of 8 images from the COCO train 2017 set, annotated with person weight (kg), height (cm), gender (0: female, 1: male), age (years), and ethnicity (0: asian, 1: white, 2: middle eastern, 3: indian, 4: latino, 5: black). The dataset has been artificially generated using a vision-language pipeline and annotated with the GPT-4 Turbo model (version 2024-04-09) deployed on Microsoft Azure. This dataset is ideal for testing and debugging object detection models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With 8 images, it is small enough to be easily manageable, yet diverse enough to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training larger datasets.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics [HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com) and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

## Dataset YAML

A YAML file is used to define the dataset configuration. It contains information about the dataset's paths, classes, and other relevant information. In the case of the COCO8-Human dataset, the `human8.yaml` file is maintained at [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/human8.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/human8.yaml).
