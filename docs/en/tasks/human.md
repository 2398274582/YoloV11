Human detection and attribute estimation is a task that involves identifying humans in an image or video stream and estimating their attributes, such as age, gender, weight, height, and ethnicity.
The output of the detector is a set of bounding boxes that enclose the humans in the image, along with class labels, confidence scores, and estimated attributes for each person. This task is useful for applications in surveillance, retail analytics, and human-computer interaction.
