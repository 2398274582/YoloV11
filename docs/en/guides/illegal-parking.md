# Illegal Parking using Ultralytics YOLOv8 ðŸš€

## What is Illegal Parking?

Illegal parking is the monitoring of abnormal parking of vehicles, which is usually used in computer applications. With [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/), you can now use the result data of [object tracking](../modes/track.md) to determine whether the vehicle is in a stopped state and how long it has been stopped, which is an important contribution to traffic safety management and urban vehicle management, especially for the rapid and active detection of vehicle breakdowns on highways, which can significantly reduce the probability of chain accidents.

## Advantages of Illegal Parking?

- **Efficient Traffic Control:** Illegal parking monitoring is actively discovered by the system, which can respond to sudden traffic incidents more quickly and greatly reduce the incidence of chain accidents, enhancing safety, and reducing congestion on roadways.
- **Enhanced Surveillance Security:** Illegal estimation in surveillance analytics helps identify unusual behaviors or potential threats, improving the effectiveness of security measures.

        video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter("illegal_parking.mp4", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

        # Illegal parking monitoring areas
        polygon_pts = [
            [
                (10, 240),
                (1550, 10),
                (1800, 10),
                (1800, 960),
                (10, 960),
            ]
        ]

        obj = IllegalParking(
            polygon_coords=polygon_pts,
            names=names,
            view_img=False,
        )

        while cap.isOpened():
            success, im0 = cap.read()
            if not success:
                print("Video frame is empty or video processing has been successfully completed.")
                break

            tracks = model.track(im0, persist=True, show=False, verbose=False)

            im0 = obj.found_illegal_parking(im0, tracks)
            video_writer.write(im0)

        cap.release()
        video_writer.release()
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
        ```

???+ warning "Parking Timer depends on the processing speed "

    The parking time is correct only when the video processing speed is greater than or equal to the video generation speed.

## FAQ

### How do I monitor object illegal parking using Ultralytics YOLOv8?

Monitoring illegally parked objects with Ultralytics YOLOv8 requires a combination of object detection and tracking techniques. First, you need to detect objects in each frame using the YOLOv8 model. Then, track these objects across frames to calculate their motion over time. Finally, use the intersection over union (IoU) of the objects between frames to determine whether the vehicle is stopped and start calculating how long it has been stopped.

**Example**:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import YOLO
from ultralytics.solutions.illegal_parking import IllegalParking

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
names = model.model.names

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4")
assert cap.isOpened(), "Error reading video file"
w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))

# Video writer
video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter("illegal_parking.mp4", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

# Init illegal-parking obj
obj = IllegalParking(names=names, view_img=False, parking_threshold=25)

while cap.isOpened():
    success, im0 = cap.read()
    if not success:
        print("Video frame is empty or video processing has been successfully completed.")
        break

    tracks = model.track(im0, persist=True, show=False, verbose=False)

    im0 = obj.found_illegal_parking(im0, tracks)
    video_writer.write(im0)

cap.release()
video_writer.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Yes, YOLOv8 can be integrated with other AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Ultralytics provides support for exporting YOLOv8 models to various formats like ONNX, TensorRT, and CoreML, ensuring smooth interoperability with other ML frameworks.

To export a YOLOv8 model to ONNX format:

```bash
yolo export --weights yolov8n.pt --include onnx
```

Learn more about exporting models in our [guide on export](../modes/export.md).

### How accurate is the illegal parking using Ultralytics YOLOv8?

The accuracy of using Ultralytics YOLOv8 to monitor illegal parking depends on several factors, including the quality of object tracking, the resolution and frame rate of the video, and environmental variables. It is almost 100% accurate in detecting parking, but the calculation of parking duration depends on the speed of video processing, that is, the performance of the GPU.

### Why choose Ultralytics YOLOv8 over other object detection models like TensorFlow Object Detection API?

Ultralytics YOLOv8 offers several advantages over other object detection models, such as the TensorFlow Object Detection API:

- **Real-Time Performance**: YOLOv8 is optimized for real-time detection, providing high speed and accuracy.
- **Ease of Use**: Designed with a user-friendly interface, YOLOv8 simplifies model training and deployment.
- **Versatility**: Supports multiple tasks, including object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation.
- **Community and Support**: YOLOv8 is backed by an active community and extensive documentation, ensuring developers have the resources they need.
