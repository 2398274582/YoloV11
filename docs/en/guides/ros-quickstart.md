### What is ROS?

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source framework widely used in robotics research and industry. It provides a collection of software libraries and tools to help developers create robot applications. ROS is designed to work with various robotic platforms, making it a flexible and powerful tool for roboticists.

### Key Features of ROS

1. **Modular Architecture**: ROS utilizes a modular architecture, allowing developers to build complex systems by combining smaller, reusable components called nodes. Each node typically performs a specific function, and nodes communicate with each other using messages over topics or services.

2. **Communication Middleware**: ROS offers a robust communication infrastructure that supports inter-process communication and distributed computing. This is achieved through a publish-subscribe model for data streams (topics) and a request-reply model for service calls.

3. **Hardware Abstraction**: ROS provides a layer of abstraction over the hardware, enabling developers to write device-agnostic code. This allows the same code to be used with different hardware setups, facilitating easier integration and experimentation.

4. **Tools and Utilities**: ROS comes with a rich set of tools and utilities for visualization, debugging, and simulation. For instance, RViz is used for visualizing sensor data and robot state information, while Gazebo provides a powerful simulation environment for testing algorithms and robot designs.

5. **Extensive Ecosystem**: The ROS ecosystem is vast and continually growing, with numerous packages available for different robotic applications, including navigation, manipulation, perception, and more. The community actively contributes to the development and maintenance of these packages.

### Evolution of ROS Versions

Since its inception in 2007, ROS has evolved through multiple versions, each introducing new features and improvements to meet the growing needs of the robotics community. The development of ROS can be categorized into two main series: ROS 1 and ROS 2. This guide focuses on the Long Term Support (LTS) version of ROS 1, known as ROS Noetic Ninjemys and the LTS of ROS 2, known as Galactic Geochelone.

???+ tip "ROS 1 vs. ROS 2"

    While ROS 1 provided a solid foundation for robotic development, ROS 2 addresses its shortcomings by offering:

    - **Real-time Performance**: Improved support for real-time systems and deterministic behavior.
    - **Security**: Enhanced security features for safe and reliable operation in various environments.
    - **Scalability**: Better support for multi-robot systems and large-scale deployments.
    - **Cross-platform Support**: Expanded compatibility with various operating systems beyond Linux, including Windows and macOS.
    - **Flexible Communication**: Use of DDS for more flexible and efficient inter-process communication.


### ROS Messages and Topics

In ROS, communication between nodes is facilitated through messages and topics. A message is a data structure that defines the information exchanged between nodes, while a topic is a named channel over which messages are sent and received. Nodes can publish messages to a topic or subscribe to messages from a topic, enabling them to communicate with each other. This publish-subscribe model allows for asynchronous communication and decoupling between nodes. Each sensor or actuator in a robotic system typically publishes data to a topic, which can then be consumed by other nodes for processing or control. For the purpose of this guide, we will focus on Image messages and camera topics. 

### Image Messages

The `sensor_msgs/Image` message type is commonly used in ROS for representing image data. It contains fields for encoding, height, width, and pixel data, making it suitable for transmitting images captured by cameras or other sensors. Image messages are widely used in robotic applications for tasks such as visual perception, object detection, and navigation.
