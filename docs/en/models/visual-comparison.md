# Visual Comparison of YOLO Models

This guide offers a visual comparison of various YOLO models, including Ultralytics YOLOv8 and Ultralytics YOLO11. Youâ€™ll see how these models perform and compare in terms of accuracy and speed across different hardware setups.

## YOLO11 vs YOLOv10

??? Tip "Environment setup"

    âœ… CUDA Version: 11.6
    âœ… OS: Windows 11
    âœ… PyTorch: 2.0.1 (CUDA Enabled)
    âœ… GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050, 8GB ðŸŽ®
    âœ… Memory: 64GB, and SSD enabled! ðŸš€ 

We have performed testing with YOLO11 medium-size model, and the speed is slightly better as compared to YOLOv10 and previous state-of-the-art object detection models.

### FPS Comparison

The FPS of YOLO11 model on an NVIDIA RTX 3050 are slightly better in comparison to YOLOv10 model, making it robust and effective object detection model today.
