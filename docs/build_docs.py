"""
This script is designed to facilitate the building of MkDocs documentation for a multilingual site.
It specifically addresses the scenario where the English documentation (located in an 'en' subdirectory)
needs to be temporarily copied to the root level of the documentation directory for MkDocs to properly
build the site. This is a workaround to handle MkDocs' limitations with multilingual documentation.

The script performs the following steps:
1. Copies all files from the 'en' directory to the root of the documentation directory.
2. Builds the MkDocs site using the main mkdocs.yml file and any other mkdocs_*.yml files in the 'docs' directory,
   allowing for building localized versions of the documentation.
3. Cleans up by removing the files that were copied to the root after the build is complete.

Usage:
    Run this script from the root directory of your MkDocs project.
    Ensure mkdocs and other dependencies are installed and accessible in your environment.

Note:
    The script uses Python's standard library modules like shutil and os for file operations
    and subprocess calls, respectively. It's built to be run in an environment where MkDocs
    and Python are already installed and configured.
