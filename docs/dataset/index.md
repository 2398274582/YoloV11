# Datasets
Dataset formats by Tasks

1. [Detection](./detection.md): Bounding box object detection is a computer vision technique that involves detecting and localizing objects in an image by drawing a bounding box around each object

2. [Instance Segmentation](./segmentation.md): Bounding instance segmentation is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and localizing objects in an image at the pixel level

3. [Pose Estimation](./pose.md): This technique is used to determine the pose of the object relative to the camera or the world coordinate system

4. [Classification](./cls.md): Image classification is a computer vision task that involves categorizing an image into one or more predefined classes or categories based on its visual content.

5. [Multi-Object Tracking](./track.md): Multi-object tracking is a computer vision technique that involves detecting and tracking multiple objects over time in a video sequence.
